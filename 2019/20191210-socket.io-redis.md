In some cases, you might want to emit events to sockets in Socket.IO namespaces / rooms from outside the context of your Socket.IO processes.

There are several ways to tackle this problem, like implementing your own channel to send messages into the process.

To facilitate this use case, we created two modules:

- [socket.io-redis](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-redis)
- [socket.io-emitter](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-emitter)


By running socket.io with the socket.io-redis adapter you can run multiple socket.io instances in different processes or servers that can all broadcast and emit events to and from each other through the Redis Pub/Sub mechanism.
